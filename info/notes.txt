This is the second interation of this game idea...
Fire squid is an arcade shooter where the player uses the mouse to aim, and wsad and arrows to move.
they need to destroy enemy ships to gain score and credits to spend in the end of round store.
a round ends if the player survives 2 minutes
After 10 rounds (or 5 on master or evil), the player must fight a boss.
the player has 4 minutes to defeat the boss or else it's an instant game over.
the player can also get a game over if they run out of health or lives.

Progress:
    Completed:
        visualized the origin point for enemy spawns and star particles.
        created the retical for aiming.
    
In progress:
    Enemy movement in regard to world space.
        if you go left then the enemy should go right but stop when the origin point hits the limit
    what I need
        when the origin point hits the limit, the game needs something to stop the enemy from going any
        farther when the player moves.
    Ideas
        bools
            if_left_limit
            if_right_limit
            if_up_limit
            if_down_limit
                this would create too many bools
            if_lock
                this can be an answer
                if limit not reached
                    action
                else:
                    if_lock = True
                then the enemy will check if the origin is locked and nullify player input
                    if not is_lock:
                        action
                Conclusion:
                    Due to the if_lock bool not contain any usefully information like what side is locked, makes
                    this solution invalid
        list
            lock_config [False, False, False, False] // [left, top, right, bottom]
        Conclusion:
            works pretty good, so I can use this to create locks.

1/20/2022
I didn't do much today because I wanted to play some games
I also got two new 3ds games, Minecraft and Battle Miner Z
with just a few minutes, I've completed the locks for the enemy.
 
Progress:
    Completed:
        Enemy player_input locks.

Next part:
    create collision with the enemy and curser

1/21/2022
So that is what I get for helping you Mr.webb... a ####### "Thanks for trying" ###### I SHOULD'VE ####### LEFT A LONG TIME AGO BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FIRST CLASS WHERE MY ASS WAS SLAPPED. THE AMOUNT OF ####### DISRESPECT
JUST A FEW WORDS IS CRAZY BUT I KNOW WHY IT WASN'T WORKING. IT WAS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ####### USE YOUR SETUP_GAME METHOD AND YOU WERE CALLING START FORM THE CLASS INSTEAD OF THE VARIABLE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M NOTE
EVER GOING TO HELP YOU WITH CODE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

anyway, I played minecraft on my 3DS and a lot of Battle Miner Z on the bus and home.

Progress:
    Completed:
        enemy collision with the curser
In progress:
    enemy movement
    Problems:
        due to the speed variable, the enemy is flying past the target location.
        Ideas:
            <>: This could help with the problem, I need to check if every axis is within an invisible span
                Enemy_x > target_x - speed and Enemy_x < target_x + speed
            Conclusion:
                It worked, but now I realised that there is another problem, but I'm going to take a break.
        
        The enemy goes to far away when on high speed because of direction.
            Ideas:
            get rid of direction and reformat the method. 
            Conclusion:
                This fixed the problem, and now I can just make it where the target positions are effected by movement

I've calmed down since yesterday, but I'm full of spite.
today I want to continue on the enemy creating the space elements to the game.
    1. create the z variable to be used in calculating the distance from the player and the scale factor. later... ok I'm back

Progress:
    Completed:
        enemy z value.
In progress:
    Nothing at this time.

The next thing I want to add is a check if the enemy is getting close to the player.
    ideas:
        So in order to make this work I'll have to strip the z_movement if z < max_z check and put it in the game loop.
        the game will warn the player if the enemy is 90% to the max z value. to make sure if any enemy is at that mark, I'll make a for loop
        that checks the z position and if any of them reach the mark then set display text warning to true.

1/23/2022
Today was a busy day, so I didn't get to do much coding today, so I need to work fast.

Progress
    warning message.

I want to go home, but not at home. I need to reset back to the default preset. Every day deteriorates while my own mind terminates. Days don't end or they stop too soon. I want to cry but nowhere to cry to. Every
second I live is just another sand added to the weight on my back I want to just let go. everyday bleeds into each other into a morbid atrocity making me lost.

1/28/2022
I finally got out of the death spiral... for now, but soon I will meet the face of anchors again.

Progress:
    different enemy types tests
    fixed warning bug. when an enemy was killed, the warning message wouldn't go away.
    created several new assets'
        player model
        gameplay gui
        ship models
In progress:
    Star particles
        star movement has already been figured out but the problem is finding a target position
        Solutions:
            I found a way to generate a random position on the circumference of a circle which is what I needed.
            I also figured out how to make it work a bit.

1/29/2022
My body feels pretty weak for some reason... it's distracting. then again I don't move a lot, and I did clean the floor, but I've not felt this weak
in years. maybe this is the pain she had, ugh. I need a placebo. I think I got something... haha

Progress:
    full implementation of the star particle system
        it will also work as bullet, explosion, and other things I can't think of other things.

In progress:
    I want ot add menus for this game, but I really don't know how to.
        Solutions:
            besides watching videos about making menus. I will just write a sample of my idea fo the system in here
            first thing I want the player to use is the start menu witch wll use the space left click button tio get to the next
            screen
            after pressing left mouse, I want to switch to a different screen where the player can select a difficulty level.
            then the player gets into the game.
            Once the player losses all their health I want the game to switch into a game overs state that can bring them back into
            the game or to the menu.
            So this will kind of look like this.
            While Running
                if not game:
                    start_menu()
                else:
                    if playing:
                        playing = game_stuff(difficulty)
                    else:
                        confi_menu = game_over()
                        game = confi_menu[0]
                        playing = confi_menu[1]

2/2/2022
I forgot to add yesterday's stuff. I'm currently reworking my code
It's been a wild code. I was going to make a new abstract group class, but I will just make a function to reorganize the sprite group.

progress:
    Completed code reformation
in progress:
    Menu things
    Game over screen
    Enemy behavior
    player bullet
Problems:
    Due to how enemies are rendered in pygame, I will need to reorganize all sprites inside the group.

2/3/2022
last night I modded my 3ds so it can do some fun stuff like custom themes, new applications, and some other things I
don't know.

Progress:
    completed enemy dynamo renderer
in progress:
    Menus:  # tomarrows goal
        main
        start
        game over  # in progress
    Enemy behavior  # get started or finish it
    player bullet

2/4/2022
I spent my whole day yesterday trying to get a psx emulator to work on my 3ds. I haven't used this to talk about making
this game at all for a while, so I want to say what I plan on doing today. So today I want to complete all the menus
for this game. I will need a main, start, and game over menu. I need to figure out how to check if the mouse is over
a button for this to work. each text object will be attached to a different function.

progress:
    completion of the menu class and main menu class.

in progress:
    options menu
    credits menu

problems:
    setting things up is difficult, I.E main menu class changes 3 variables and keeping track of them is hard with a
    return function

2/5/2022
#### #### #### #### #### #### #### #### #### #################### ####### ########. I need to study tkinter for the
surprise skill usa thing.
Anyway, last night I got my 3ds to run psx games. Now I can play LSD Dream Emulator and I.Q. on the go without needing
to bring a big xbox controller.
Today I want to continue working on the menus for the game and reformat the game initializer code in game_start.py file

Progress:
    total overhaul on start_game method// now a part of a class
    reformatted all current menus, so they can call for information from the new class with start_game.

In progress:
    Game over menu
        The very thing that started this
    Options menu
        Because the video had it, and I will need it for those sedative eared pebbles in the class (I'm one of them).
    Credits menu
        To display my greatness (and several of the main contributors.)

2/9/2022:
It's been four days since I could code again...
Today I had the skill usa competetion today and I couldn't finish the project in time. I was struggling with everything. the apps where not close
to what I thought they would be and I failed. My competeter asked me if I finished the code, I said no and he rejoiced in happiness and said something close
to thank god... I sat in the class room for a few minuests and then the teacher started speaking to me. I said that I belived in myself... he laughed.
He laughed... and then started spewing lies to me. Clever, smart, and other lies that can't be backed up. I failed the only person that belived in
me and made myself look like a fool. During the test their was cheering for us, by us I mean just my competeter... no one belives in me.
I'm just another stupid programmer that got into the program from just pity. I wanted to prove myself, but I ###### it up and I know I am
the teachers worst contestant. I would not have joined skills USA if i was not blinded by false sense of hope near the beggining of school.
I am the fool who belived in himself... I'll now have to serve the price, Fractured low self-esteam, Diminished will, Smothered hope,
and a desire to leave the program. Why should I stay... I should have left months ago... but I can not leave, I'm stuck.

Today I want to create round timer and enemy behavior
    the round timer will start a few seconds after the player enters the game then starts a counter to 1 minute before switching to end round
    stuff.
    though I want to work on firerate

    Enemy behavior is also something I need to do.
        get rid of Morphers for now
        launchers will shoot missles at a random point
        shooters will shoot bullets at the center point
        chasers will go to the center point

2/10/2022
Today I was delt an ace by the draw and got a 100% on my history test.

I want to create a round system that I develped from timer test where after a round 
create fire rate thing
develop enemy firing
add music
add sprites
add sounds

Completed:
    created beta round timer in timertest
    created enemy behavior
Incomplete
    Game round timer// unimplemented
    Launcehr and shooter don't fire anything
        I think the best way to make this work, is by creating a fire interval variable and last fired variable
            for Launcehrs, they will need to have a target so the player knows where the missle is going.
    implement music
        I already have a handfull of music that I'll use. All midis, the best music format because I can use copyrigted music legaly
        due to a technecality with creating a midi. Though I read it from google from Quora
        https://www.quora.com/Are-downloaded-MIDI-files-copyright-free#:~:text=domain%20or%20not.-,The%20MIDI%20File%20is%20protected%20by%20a%20separate%20copyright%20because,a%20'public%20domain'%20song.
    implement better sprites
        this will take time to make since I'll need to set up everything for the sprites
    implement sound effects
        I hate this part, zapsplat is a terrible place to get sound effects... probly because I don't know how to use it.
Problems:
    Chaser enemy moves eredicly because the player affects the target location.
        I will need ot make a check to not allow the player to affect the target location for chasers
    Game over screen has cursor problem.
        I'll need to look at it.

2/12/2022
I forgot to do notes yesterday...
Anyway, Today I want to run some tests to see if I can use a certain method to delete enemies. I could also create limits for each enemy type:
Also I need to figure out a good way to make enemy projectiles. should they be enemies or projectiles. Also, how should they spawn in...
they could be based off of a enemy timer inside the enemy, and when it hits the timer, it can shoot. or  should they be based off of a timer
inside the actual game class that spawns a bullet from a random enemy that's on the screen. Alot of options to choose.

For the projectiles, I think I will use a diffent Group for this because I alraedy have the particle calss ready for this but I'll need To
modify my enemy regroup funtion to be more mutable so it can be used by the projectile class.
So, I'll make the random shoot funtion be craeted in the game class. I'll also proably need to create sepreate group class to store each enemy
seperatly... no that's a bad idea because then I would be making several groups for no reason.

I'll also need to make it where shooters and Launcehrs will fly away in a random direction then self.kill themsselves. the problem is
if the enemy will turn into a ghost sprite and still count in the enemy group class.

I think I have everything figured out.

New enemy behavoir - Escape for rangers(shooters & launchers)
    spawn time == time enemy created
    attack length == 10 seconds unless round is over then isntantly in escape model

New game behavior - ranger attacks (shooters & launchers)
    ############################################################ scraped ############################################################
    enemy firerate start == start if round
    enemy firerate == 1000 * ((number if enemies / max amout of enemies) * 100) + 100 
    if current time - enem firerate start >  enemy firerate then... uh oh this is bad
        So because the enemy group incompeses the chaser enemy, I guess I'll need to make a seperate group for rangesrs... ugh
        now I really need to modify the reorganization funtion. let me think
        enemy fighter group
        enemy ranger group
        boss group <--- this was going to be here anyway.

        reorganize method 
        grab all fighters and regornise them
        re-add all of the fighters back into their group but keep a seperate list of them to draw
        grab all rangers and reorganize them
        re-add all the rangers and keep a list of them
        add both fighter and ranger lsits together and reorganize them then draw them... I'm going to vomit
    ############################################################ scraped ############################################################
    this is idea is scraped because the amount of things I would need to do to make this way work so I'll go for every individual enemy
    timers.

    for enemies
        rangers can't fire from the start until tney reach their z_max or what I should have called it, Z_targ
        once they reach the z_max, their state is chanfged to fighting

        inside of the game class, I'll need to add a new funtion
        for every enemy in the enemy group
            if the enemy is a ranger then grab enemies state and check if it's fighting
                if the enemy is fighiting then grab can fire value
                    if the enemy can't fire then get the current time and set it as the start time
                    else:
                        current time - enemies' start time > enemy fire rate
                        if that is true then create a bullet then set the enmies start time to current time

    New enemy types:
        missles
            slower than a bullet. creates a retical that the missle will travel to when it hits the z_max, the the game will check if
            it is inside the player bound box then damage the player if so.
        bullets
            faster than a ship, it's target position is the where the center screen is. will do the same check as the bulelt

Progress:
    gameover music
    more game music
    enemies:
        created better enemy ship I.E points, damage, and timer things
        added sprites for all avaliable ships
        beginings of run away behavoir
            self.kill() does work with no side effects.
        
    Enemy firing behavoir
    full projectile implementation
Inprogress:
    player collision check ver 2
        Due to projectile now being in the game. I need to create a way to make sure if the bullets can't hit the player if they aren't inside of a player collison box
        This collision box only affects projectiles.
        I will need to make a rectagle then place it smewhere in the middle of the screen.
Problems:
    the game lags due to size of chaser enemy// fixed
        There is no easy way to fix this from my knowledge. so I jsut decreased the z_max in settings to a point where the chaser won't get too big.

2/13/2022
I have no thoughts at the moment.

So today I want to make the player collison box. I could have done it a long time ago, but I didn't have any projectiles that would need to be acounted for.
So the idea is to make the rectangle bassed off the size of bullets for the sides which has a max width of 24 * 6 wich is 144
So the height will be sort of bassed off the eney targeting offsets which is targ_y = randrange(129, wn_height-74) but I'll need to change the offset for with 144 so it more like targ_y = randrange(129, wn_height-144)
######################## Scrapped ########################
129 + 144 = 273 total offset 500 - 273 = 227 player height
122*2 = 244 total offset 500 - 244 = 256 player width
######################## Scrapped ########################
I looked at the actual window size and I figured out that they are acually
width = 800
height = 600
I have no idea where I keep getting 500 from but I can use some of the calcuations from the scrapped part ot redo the size and stuff
800 - 273 = 527 width
600 - 244 = 356 height

Then I need to place the rectangle from the topcenter at x = half of screen width and and the height will be 129 

Progress:
    Completed:
    sound effects has been added
    player collision box
    timer and round text has been added
Inprogress:
    Nothing for now
Problems:
    player fire sound was overlapping because of the sound player being played more than necesary becasue of the enemies that where checked// fixed
        I just needed to remove the sound player from the enemy check loop

2/14/2020
I couldn't present my game today because my stomach was in great pain and I couldn't relive my pain due to being in a rush to get back to the class room for a potental
presentaion with my name on it. In the end, my stomach was unhappy, several failed attempts to relive the pain until I could actually relive it properly by relaxing.

5. make boss incounters
6. make cut scenes
7. make the leader board
8. make dead man difficulty

3/13/2022
I got some new games for my 2DS.

Version 4.0.1

Today I want to reformat everything or fix up some issues.
Fixed up some code the enemy and game
enemy projectiles should move better and space looks better.
few new music tracks have been added for the bosses
credits system now works

3/14/2022
I want to start working on the upgrades
Upgrades should be perminate upgrades except for health
I want to start making base classes that a class can call upon 
The issue I see causing problems is upgrade activation since my experience making projectiles to work though I have some ideas
    1. State based
        This method can be used to create checks.

frame work
The base class should contain the main interation of the object.
    examples
        object interations
            Idle
            Hovered
            Select-succesce
            Select-failed
        Text interation
            Selectable = Bool
The class needs to be able to collect the players information.
    examples
        difficulty
        credits
        total rounds
        if round was a boss round.
        Upgrade level if needed
# I'm noticing I might need a player info class to store player inforamtion easily.
The child class will store the upgrades effect, icon, and text posistion.

3/15/2022
Today is the profefcinolaizm cininar and I am not ready. I have everything but I don't know what to do and thursday is the mock interveiw. I am going to be sick.

I want to create the player information class because it might make my life easier.
This class will have to be created all the way in Game start and shoved into several other classes. This will effectivly create a centralized area to keep player inforamtion to be quickly get and delete data.
I should be able to restart player information easily

3/17/2022
Today was mock interveiws and I think I did well until I reentered the room #### ah #### ###### my head.

I'm working on preparing the program for the upgrade update and boss update.

Here is the plan.

1. Prepare the code for boss rounds 
    a. To make this I will need to make a check if 4 rounds have past. if this is true then one boss round is
        is added to the player info. During a boss round, the game will switch to a boss state using a bool like
        isBoss. In this state only the boss and player can enteract with the game world.
    b. Ready the boss timer. The player will have 1-4 minutes to beat the boss. If the player fails to beat the
        boss, then the game is instantly over.
        ba. Later on I want to add diffent boss requirments. One requirement is Survive where the palyer hast to
            survive the encounter.
            
2. Start working on the upgrade class.
    a. crate the base class.
        aa. This class will control what all of the upgrades will operate. This includes movement and interation.
    b. create the 2 main upgrades.
        ba. This will be used to create upgrades that affect the game. This class will contain the icons and text
            for the upgrades.
        bb. This will contain the upgrade function. the base class can't be used to pre store functions because I could have to
            already pre made all the functions which is a valid way to do it, thoughe I want to keep this game as mutable
            as possible.

3/25/2022
I lost track of what I was doing... uh.
