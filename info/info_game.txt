/ thoughts
I have no idea what most of this means. So lets disect it

5 * hp_upgrade + (((2 * int( 0.5 * rounds)) * (1 * difficulty_value)) - (15 * rounds)
hp_upgrade is level
rounds is total rounds the player has been through
difficult_value is the difficult number

further disection
5 * hp_upgrade + 
This makes sense 5 times the level

(
    ((2 * int( 0.5 * rounds)) * difficulty_value)
    2 is added every 2 rounds times the difficulty


    - (15 * rounds)
    This makes no sense because This will just casue a negative value all any time a price calculation is
    active. This will be removed.

5 * hp_upgrade + ((2 * int( 0.5 * rounds)) * difficulty_value)

4500 credits have been gained in a good preforming run on dead man

5 * 1 + ((2 * int( 0.5 * 1) * 5)
5 creadits which is a bad number

^5^ * 1 + ^((2 * int( 0.5 * 1) * 5)^
everything inside of the ^^ is a problem area
5 represents the base price of the upgrade which is too low
5 shouls be 1000 points

((2 * int( 0.5 * 1) * 5)
2 is the added price
0.5 is the double multiplier only doubling if rounds is a multiple of 2 or something
1 is the total rounds
5 is the Difficulty

The problem with this equation is that in one round all of this is just 0. the difficulty should always affect the price
of the item.
(1000 * level + (200 * int(0.5 * rounds))) * dificulty
This is becoming better but if the difficulty is 0 then everything is free
ugh oh I got it
if value > 0:
    math
else:
math minus dificulty
